        <h1>Meet Denali.</h1>
        <div class="text">Denali is a 5½ year old German Shepherd mix who loves sticks, laying on the couch, hiking, and the occasional swim. She is quite popular and attracts attention from all the boy dogs whenever she goes out on the town. However she is already in a committed relationship with her long-time boyfriend Piñon.

      <div class="quote">Denali is a creature that completely eludes understanding. When you look at her you are not sure if you are looking at a domesticated house pet, a buttery croissant, or an otherworldly being that transcends our mortal understanding. While she may occasionally take on the form a floofy chonk laying on the couch, in reality she is so much more. She is beauty, she is mystery, she is enlightenment, she is confusion, she is perfection, she is chaos.</div>
